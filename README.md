Iâ€™ll provide a better description later but for now, `optweight`
contains the function `optweight()` which generates weights to balance
treatments to given balance thresholds. It solves a quadratic
programming problem to minimize the variance of the weights using
`lsei()` in the `limSolve` package. This is the method described in
Zubizarreta (2015).

In addition to binary point treatments, `optmatch` can handle
multinomial treatments; longitudinal treatments are coming soon.
