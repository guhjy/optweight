# optweight

I'll provide a better description later but for now, `optweight` contains the function `optweight()` which generates weights to balance treatments to given balance thresholds. It solves a quadratic programming problem to minimize the variance of the weights using `lsei()` in the `limSolve` package. This is the method described in Zubizarreta (2015).

In addition to binary point treatments, `optmatch` can handle multinomial treatments; longitudinal treatments are coming soon.
